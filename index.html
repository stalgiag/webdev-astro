          Atlanta is a city in the forest
        </h2>
        <p>
          We have the highest percentage of tree canopy of any major
          metropolitan area in America. Our canopy is the main factor in
          ensuring Atlanta&rsquo;s resiliency in the face of climate change. The
          forest in Southeast Atlanta is home to wetlands that filter rainwater
          and prevent flooding. It is also one of the last breeding grounds for
          many amphibians in the region, as well as an important migration site
          for wading birds.
        </p>

        <p>
          The history of this particular land is deeply scarred. In the 1800s
          shortly after the land was stolen from Muscogee Creek peoples, it was
          used as a plantation. In the early 1900s, a prison farm was opened
          where inmates were forced to perform unpaid agricultural labor,
          marking the rebranding of slavery into for profit prison labor. The
          Atlanta Police Department currently uses this hallowed ground as a
          firing range.
        </p>

        <p>
          This forest is at risk of destruction as the police and Hollywood make
          plans to pave over Atlanta&rsquo;s largest remaining green space.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Atlanta Police Department seeks to turn 300 acres of forest into a
          tactical training compound featuring a mock city. This project was
          announced to the shock of community members who had been given no
          opportunity to weigh in on the proposal. The entire process has been
          shadier than the forest itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          Intrenchment Creek is an existing public park adjacent to the Prison
          Farm. Dekalb County seeks to swap this land with Blackhall Studios
          (now rebranded as “Shadowbox Studios”), a major film production
          company. Blackhall wants to clear cut 170 acres of forest to develop
          into an airport and erect the largest sound stage in America. This
          project would cement Atlanta as the new Hollywood, making the cost of
          living in our city outrageous.
        </p>

        <p>
          We refuse to let our forest be bulldozed in favor of the police and
          sold out to Hollywood. There are many forms of action and advocacy to
          be taken. This is a broad, decentralized, autonomous movement. Get
          involved in whatever ways move you. Take a walk in the forest with
          your friends.

            Press release: As public opposition grows, Atlanta police attempt to
            begin work on Cop City, protestors occupy trees
          </h3>
          <p>
            As of June 1, Atlanta Police have accompanied contractors Long
            Engineering, Brasfield & Gorrie and other contracted workers to the
            woods to attempt to stay on schedule with a forest destruction
            timeline which sets clearing the forest to begin by the end of June.
            Activists on the ground have reported heavy machinery clearing trees
            along the perimeter of the proposed site, as well as seemingly
            random tree-felling deeper inside the forest. This work is being
            conducted without the proper permits from Dekalb County Office of
            Planning & Sustainability.

            Emory doctors condemn Cop City, call to fund public health
            initiatives instead
          </h3>
          <p>
            As physicians who work in Atlanta and participate within the Georgia
            Human Rights Clinic, and with experience evaluating asylum seekers
            and victims of various forms of abuses, we have grave concerns with
            the establishment of such a facility. We witness the further
            militarization of police in Atlanta and throughout this country and
            grow increasingly alarmed. This facility will be one of if not the
            largest police training facilities in the United States.
